# neonGL

[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jxw0gg81re0ug7bj?svg=true)]

## Big changes ahead!
neonGL is the next step for the neon2d engine. It will allow us to render without all the extra bloat of using Windows Forms. If your into that kind of thing check out [the info page](https://neon2d.github.io/neonGL) or check out [the repository itself](https://github.com/neon2d/neon2d) which is still in the early stages of development

## Important:

The n2d project is a demo project

While */packages* is not empty, none of the packages are used

This whole repo is literally just a mirror of neon2d but it will be building out further
